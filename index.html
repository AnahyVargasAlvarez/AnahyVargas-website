        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, I’m Anahy Vargas. My pronouns are she/her. Welcome to my website. I am from the Coachella Valley. I am 18 years old. Since the age of 11, I’ve been fascinated with everything that has to do with healthcare. In high school I was part of the pre med pathway called health and nutrition science academy training. Where I got Career Technical Training. I enjoyed all my classes in that course. My favorite assignment we did in that class was when we did a google slides presentation on Covid-19 pandemic. Back when cases were first  rising and were new. We did research on the topic and read articles and the news to stay on top of all the daily new information. We made a journal about how the pandemic affected me and my family. I also learned how important it is to be thankful for what you have and not to take things for granted. We also would have a journey where we would write how we would feel. And I love how personal and free the project was which made it one of my favorite assignments.<br><br>
        In my first year in my Medical Terminology classI got knowledge of the system vital signs and learned about different careers. I got knowledgeable about health and disease in the human body. My second year in my class called Health Science Preparation I learned the knowledge of health and disease in the human body. Learned how to investigate outbreaks. Learned basics of vaccines and the use of antibodies. As well as Diagnosis/ treatment of cancer. Diagnosis imaging. Diagnosing infection throughout ELISA testing. In my senior year in my CTE class named Health Science Internship. I got certificates on topics such as  Medical Ethics, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Bloodborne pathogens training, Medical ethics training, Infection control training, CPR/First Aid certifications. Most importantly I learned how to take care of my overall health of the body, mind and soul. Relationship of nutrition and health. Learned about the six essential nutrients. Importance of nutrition throughout different stages of life. Medical nutrition therapy, and care of patients with special needs. Which is why I decided to get further knowledge and continue my education and go to college. In hopes of going to medical school and becoming a doctor specifically a dermatologist. I have loved everything that has to do with skin care  since I was small and I love how I can combine my passions into one career choice.<br><br>
         I also love learning and in the medical field you always learn something new which I really enjoy. I am also bilingual, I speak both English and spanish. So I believe it is a very important skill to have especially in the healthcare system because coming from a hispanic household my parents both speak one language and I would have to translate for them, at the doctor’s office because there are not many physicians that speak two languages. I would also like to learn more languages throughout my lifetime so I can better communicate with others. It will be very beneficial not only for my career but for my life in general. Being able to speak to a lot of people of different backgrounds and cultures is very beautiful in my opinion. I have loved learning ever since I was small. I loved going to school, which is why I decided to major in biology. I am a first generation college student. I am in my first year of college at University of Riverside.
